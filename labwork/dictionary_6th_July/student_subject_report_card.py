Lab 5: Student Subject Report Card 
Problem Statement: 
Create a nested dictionary to store marks of students in three subjects. 
Example: 
'Priya': {'Math': 78, 'Science': 95, 'English': 82}, 
'Ankit': {'Math': 91, 'Science': 89, 'English': 94} 
} 
Write a program to: 
* Calculate the total marks of each student.  
* Calculate the average marks of each student.  
* Display the topper based on total marks.  
* Display the subject-wise highest marks along with the student's name.  
* Display students whose average is greater than or equal to 85.
